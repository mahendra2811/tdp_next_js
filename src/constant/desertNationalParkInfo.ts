        'The Desert National Park is situated in the northwestern region of India, specifically in the state of Rajasthan. It spans across an area of approximately 3,162 square kilometers, making it one of the largest national parks in the country. The park\'s geography is characterized by vast stretches of arid and semi-arid desert landscapes, including sand dunes, rocky terrains, and salt flats. Its proximity to the city of Jaisalmer, often referred to as the "Golden City," makes it easily accessible to visitors. The park was gazetted in 1980. The park mostly consists of sand dunes (44%) but also has pediments, pavements, and structural plains. Desert National Park also has fossils from the Jurassic Period.',

Visitors to the park can witness hardy desert flora such as thorny bushes, drought-resistant shrubs, and salt-tolerant vegetation. Habitats that are found in the park include open grassland, thorny bushes, and dunes. 168 plant species have been recorded in the park.

Among the park's residents are the elusive desert fox, Indian wolf, and desert cat. It's also a habitat for reptiles like the spiny-tailed lizard and saw-scaled viper. The park's varied landscapes provide shelter to these creatures and offer a unique opportunity for wildlife enthusiasts to spot them in their natural habitat. The Chinkara or Indian Gazelle (Gazella bennettii) is a common antelope of this region. The national park's other notable inhabitants are the desert fox, wolf and desert cat. Birdlife in this sandy habitat is vivid and spectacular. Birds such as sandgrouse, partridges, bee-eaters, larks, and shrikes are commonly seen. In the winter, the birdlife is augmented by species such as the demoiselle crane and MacQueen's bustard. Perhaps the greatest attraction of the park is a bird called the great Indian bustard, a critically endangered species found only in India. Desert National Park is one of the last sites in which this species can be found in good numbers. As such, the species draws in thousands of birdwatchers from all over the world. In addition to the great Indian bustard, the park supports a variety of other birds of interest to birdwatchers and conservationists alike.",
